# ScienceQtech Employee Performance Mapping

## Project Overview

ScienceQtech, an established startup in the Data Science industry, is getting ready for its yearly assessment cycle. To streamline the process, the HR department has assigned the Junior Database Administrator the duty of creating complete reports on personnel information, performance, and project engagements. This effort attempts to improve understanding of employee contributions while enabling effective performance mapping.

## Objective

The primary goal is to analyze the employee database to:

  --> Determine the maximum salary of employees.
  
  --> Ensure all job roles align with the organizationâ€™s profile standards.
  
  --> Calculate bonuses to estimate additional expenses.
  
  --> Identify employees needing training to boost overall organizational performance.

## Steps to Perform
#### 1. Data Acquisition:

 --> Download the dataset
 --> Create tables to store the data as described in the dataset.
 
#### 2. Data Analysis:

  ##### Employee Records:
  
          Extract key details such as EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, ROLE, DEPT, EXP, COUNTRY, CONTINENT, SALARY, EMP_RATING, MANAGER_ID, and PROJ_ID.
          
  #####   Project Information:
  
          Extract project details including PROJECT_ID, PROJ_Name, DOMAIN, START_DATE, CLOSURE_DATE, DEV_QTR, and STATUS.

  ##### Data Science Team:

          Verify and map the details of employees within the Data Science team.

 #### 3. Performance Mapping:

        --> Generate reports to show the maximum salary and compare it across different roles and departments.
        
        --> Validate that all job roles meet the organization's standards.
        
        --> Calculate bonuses based on performance ratings to estimate additional expenses.
        
        --> Identify training needs for employees to enhance their performance.

## Conclusion
By properly mapping employee performance and producing detailed reports, ScienceQtech can efficiently manage its assessment cycle, ensuring that deserving personnel are recognized and rewarded. The project will result in better resource allocation, improved training programs, and higher overall performance.
